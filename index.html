							have to write a sentence for each of the verbs and, also, the exercise of listening the
							audio and after writing what you've been listening. This is a complete exercise to learn a
							phrasal verb, his meaning, his sound, his use, his writing. I hope I can improve my English
							with this type of exercise."
